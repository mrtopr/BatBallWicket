# 🏏 Bat Ball Wicket

**Bat Ball Wicket** is a simple, fun, and interactive web-based game inspired by the popular cricket-inspired hand game often played between friends — similar to *Rock Paper Scissors* but with a cricket twist!  

You play against the computer, choosing **Bat**, **Ball**, or **Wicket**, and the computer makes its move randomly. The result is instantly displayed along with a live scoreboard that updates automatically and is saved locally on your browser using `localStorage`.
